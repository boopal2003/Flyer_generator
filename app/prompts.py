    "THEN compose a finished flyer around that render.\n"
    "HARD RULES:\n"
    "• Do NOT alter or invent any text, logos, colors, or brand elements from the artwork.\n"
    "• Preserve exact typography, spelling, and proportions; keep label text crisp and legible.\n"

    "• Typography: bold headline plus concise subhead; balanced negative space.\n"
    "• Output aspect: {aspect_note}. Render at the provided base size."
